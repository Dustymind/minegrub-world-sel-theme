# Minecraft World Selection Grub Theme
Wowie, another Minecraft grub theme! But this time it's in the style of the singleplayer world selection menu, which makes a little more sense than selecting your operating system from the main menu.
There are also *icons* now! Isn't that great? And even better, they also include the descriptive text below each boot option!

I want to create some icons first, here, enjoy this short readme while i secretly experiment with some greater stuff (i like big reveals)
